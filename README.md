    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Memorly-AI/agent-toolkit.git
    cd agent-toolkit
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    This project uses `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create a .env File**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store all API related credentials. And append it's path into the .gitignore file

4. **Update .gitignore**
    Ensure your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being version controlled.

5. **Configure Environment**
    Update environment variables as needed to reflect your setup (e.g., database configurations, API keys) in the `.env` file.

6. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

7. **Access the Tool Kit**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to access the toolkit.

## Usage
To use the toolkit, configure your preferred platforms and connect your AI agent by specifying the available APIs. Each API is modular and designed to be straightforward for quick integration.

For example:
- **CRM Automation**: Use the toolkit’s APIs to automate lead management on Salesforce.
- **E-Commerce Management**: Automate Shopify workflows for inventory updates and order tracking.

Documentation for each API and how to connect to specific platforms can be found in the `docs` folder.
